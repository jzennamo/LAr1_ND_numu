1) Finish binning studies

2) Chi2 surface studies
 -> Study the surfaces for different configurations and with different assumptions
 -> Study the projections of the surfaces onto a given \Delta m^{2} point and compare the curves 

3) Jelly Bean plots
 -> Inject signal and see how precisely we can resolve it
 -> Will want to restructure the code such that we can activate this with a boolean
