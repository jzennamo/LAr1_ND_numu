To run NtupleReprocessing.C you need to do the following:

open root:

> root

Then compile NtupleReprocessing.C:

> .L NtupleReprocessing.C+

Then load the wanted file:

> NtupleReprocessing s("_file_");  (where "_file_" is whatever file you want)

Then loop over that file:

>s.Loop("numu", _Detector_, 1);

Then your output file will be in the same directory as "_file_" but labled "Joseph_Smeared"
