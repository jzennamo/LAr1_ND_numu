To run:

first run over "organized_fitting_muon_CorrelatedErrors.C" with the detectors and options you want

NOTE: Be sure to change the name of the output root file at the end! 

These output root files are stored in the "\output" directory

Then you will use those as inputs to "Chi2_Surface.C"

to run Chi2_Surface.C

do:

> root Chi2_Surface.C+

enjoy the pretty outputs!
